    `I started out when I was 11 building custom sites for insurance agents,
  spinning up custom game servers and databases with private server files,
  and made my first open-source contribution when I was 12, which was a
  registration script for MapleStory private servers.`,
    `I then got into competitive esports where I played high stakes Counter
  Strike: Source, World of Warcraft, and StarCraft II. Reaching greater
  than 1% of North America across all games and competing in many
  tournaments.`,
    `I am entirely self-educated, dropping out of school when I was 14. I
  taught myself how to learn, learned almost off of Khan Academy, then
  moved onto Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), where I studied history,
  philosophy, economics, computer science, cryptography, softwares, & many
  more fields. I think I have completed around 75+ MOOCs and 100+ books.
  Very similar to that of Scott Young's journey of ultralearning, except,
  not focusing so much on what MIT wanted me to learn and what I needed
  and wanted to learn.`,
    `I have since then built many cool Bitcoin Lightning Network apps such as
  Payment Splitting, emeralize (an e-learning platform), Automatic
  Withdrawals to LN Address, and much more.`,
    `I am the VP, Business Intelligence at a payments fintech
  called ZEBEDEE that uses Bitcoin's Lightning Network technology to
  facilitate borderless and real-time payments of any amount. I play the
  role of a product leader, designer, educator, senior manager, &
  strategist.`,
    `I am the Executive Director of the AZ Bitcoin Network where I organize educational and social events for the community. I've organized the Lightning Village at TABconf 2023 and the hackathon at the conference.`,
